        <ol>
            <li><strong>Enter Your Weight:</strong> Input your current weight for accurate results.</li>
            <li><strong>Input Calories:</strong> Type in the number of calories you want to convert.</li>
            <li><strong>Set Your Pace:</strong> Choose your walking pace to tailor the calculation.</li>

        <h2>Understanding the Calculation</h2>
        <p>Our calculator uses a scientific approach to convert calories into steps. Here's how it works:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Determining Energy Expenditure</h3>
        <p>We use a measure called MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) to estimate how much energy you burn while walking. The MET value changes based on your walking pace:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Slow walking: Lower energy expenditure</li>
            <li>Moderate walking: Medium energy expenditure</li>
            <li>Fast walking: Higher energy expenditure</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Calculating Calories Burned per Minute</h3>
        <p>Using your weight and the MET value, we calculate how many calories you burn per minute of walking.</p>

        <h3>3. Time Needed to Burn Calories</h3>
        <p>We then determine how many minutes of walking it would take to burn the number of calories you specified.</p>

        <h3>4. Converting Time to Steps</h3>
        <p>Finally, we estimate how many steps you would take in that time, considering:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your height (which affects your stride length)</li>
            <li>Your walking pace</li>
            <li>Average steps per mile (about 2,000 for a person of average height)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This process gives you a personalized estimate of steps needed to burn your specified calories, tailored to your body and walking style.</p>
