                    <p>Most people burn between 0.04 and 0.05 calories per step, though this varies based on individual factors.</p>

                    <p>For a person weighing around 160 lbs (72.5 kg), it takes approximately 2,500 steps at an average pace (3 mph) to burn 100 calories.</p>

                <div class="carousel-slide">
                    <p>Walking 10,000 steps burns approximately 300-500 calories for an average person weighing about 70 kg (154 lb).</p>

                <div class="carousel-slide">
                    <p>The heavier you are, the more calories you burn per step - extremely overweight individuals may burn up to 3 times more calories per step than a person of normal weight.</p>

                <div class="carousel-slide">
                    <p>Walking at a faster pace (4 mph vs. 3 mph) reduces the number of steps needed to burn 100 calories from about 2,500 to 2,000.</p>

                <div class="carousel-slide">
                    <p>Most people burn 30-40 calories for every 1,000 steps they walk.</p>

                <div class="carousel-slide">
                    <p>10,000 steps is equivalent to approximately 4.5-5 miles (7.24-8 km) of walking distance.</p>

                <div class="carousel-slide">
                    <p>Walking 10,000 steps typically takes about 1.5-2 hours at a casual pace of 3.2 mph (5.15 kph).</p>

                <div class="carousel-slide">
                    <p>Running the same distance as 10,000 steps (about 4.5-5 miles) would burn roughly double the calories compared to walking.</p>

                    <p>Your age affects calorie burn - as you get older, your metabolism slows down, and you burn fewer calories per step.</p>
