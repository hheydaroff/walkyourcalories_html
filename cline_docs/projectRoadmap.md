- [ ] Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4): Implement core pages and integrate calculator widget
- [ ] Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6): Enhance responsive design, optimize performance, and improve accessibility
- [ ] Sprint 4 (Weeks 7-8): Conduct thorough testing and refinement
- [ ] Sprint 5 (Weeks 9-10): Final touches, prepare for launch

## Future Considerations
- Implement more advanced step calculation algorithms
- Add more comprehensive tests for routes and validators
- Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
- Implement logging for better debugging and monitoring
- Consider creating a development/production configuration system
- Implement analytics to track user engagement and conversions
- Explore progressive web app (PWA) capabilities
- Implement internationalization and localization for multiple languages
- Consider adding a mobile app version using a cross-platform framework
