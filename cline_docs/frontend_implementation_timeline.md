## Notes
- This timeline is flexible and may be adjusted based on progress and any unforeseen challenges
- Regular code reviews should be conducted throughout the development process
- Performance and accessibility should be considered at every stage of development
- Any backend API changes needed should be communicated and coordinated with the backend team
- User feedback should be collected and incorporated throughout the development process
