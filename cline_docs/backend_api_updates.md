# Backend API Updates

To support the new frontend requirements for the Walk Your Calories application, the following updates to the backend API are necessary:

## 1. New Routes

Create new routes for additional pages:
- `/how-it-works`
- `/benefits`
- `/faq`
- `/about`

These routes will primarily serve static content and can be implemented as simple GET requests returning the appropriate data or template.

## 2. Enhanced Step Calculation API

Modify the existing step calculation endpoint:
- Route: `/api/calculate-steps` (changed from '/')
- Method: POST
- Input parameters:
  - calories (float)
  - weight (float)
  - height (float)
  - stride_length (float)
  - pace (string)
- Return: JSON response with calculated steps and additional metadata

## 3. Food Database API

Implement a new API for food item calorie lookup:
- Route: `/api/food-lookup`
- Method: GET
- Query parameters:
  - query (string): search term
  - limit (int, optional): number of results to return
- Return: JSON response with matching food items and their calorie information

## 4. User Profile API

Create APIs for user profile management:
- Route: `/api/profile`
- Methods: GET, POST, PUT
- Functionality:
  - GET: Retrieve user profile
  - POST: Create new user profile
  - PUT: Update existing user profile
- Input/Output: JSON containing user profile information (weight, height, stride length, etc.)

## 5. Fitness Tracker Integration API

Implement APIs for fitness tracker integration:
- Route: `/api/fitness-tracker`
- Methods: GET, POST
- Functionality:
  - GET: Retrieve synced data from fitness trackers
  - POST: Sync new data from fitness trackers
- Input/Output: JSON containing fitness tracking data

## 6. Error Handling and Logging

Extend the existing error handling and logging to cover all new API endpoints:
- Implement proper error responses for all APIs (400 for bad requests, 404 for not found, etc.)
- Ensure all API calls are logged for monitoring and debugging purposes

## 7. Authentication and Authorization

Implement a basic authentication system to support user profiles and data persistence:
- Route: `/api/auth`
- Methods: POST (login), DELETE (logout)
- Implement JWT or session-based authentication

## 8. Database Integration

To support the food database and user profiles, integrate a database system (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB) into the backend.

## Next Steps

1. Refactor the existing codebase to support these new API endpoints
2. Implement new services and utilities to handle the additional functionality
3. Set up a database and create necessary models/schemas
4. Update the project dependencies in requirements.txt
5. Write unit tests for all new API endpoints and services
6. Update the documentation to reflect these changes

By implementing these updates, the backend will be able to support the new frontend requirements and provide a more robust and feature-rich API for the Walk Your Calories application.
