# Current Task

## Current Objective
Update the website's font to IBM Plex and document the changes

## Context
This task is part of the ongoing frontend implementation and improvement process. We have just completed updating the website's font to IBM Plex, which contributes to the overall goal of creating a modern and consistent user interface.

## Completed Steps
1. Updated the CSS file (static/css/styles.css) to use IBM Plex fonts:
   - Changed body font to IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Serif
   - Updated headings (h1-h6) to use IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Serif
   - Modified calculator and form elements to use IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Serif
2. Ensured consistency across all elements that previously used different fonts
3. Verified that the changes were successfully applied

## Next Steps
1. Update codebaseSummary.md to reflect the recent font changes
2. Review the entire website to ensure the new font is applied correctly and consistently
3. Test the website on different browsers and devices to verify font rendering
4. Update any design documentation or style guides to reflect the new font choice
5. Consider performance implications of using web fonts and implement optimizations if necessary
6. Continue with the next tasks in the frontend implementation plan

## Additional Considerations
1. Evaluate the need for font subsetting to improve loading times
2. Consider adding fallback fonts for better compatibility across different systems
3. Assess the impact of the new font on the overall layout and make adjustments if needed
4. Update any marketing materials or brand guidelines to reflect the new font usage

## Notes
- The font change contributes to the project goals of improving the user interface and creating a consistent brand identity
- This change may impact the layout and readability of the website, so thorough testing is crucial
- Consider gathering user feedback on the new font to ensure it enhances the user experience

## Potential Challenges
- Ensuring consistent font rendering across different browsers and operating systems
- Balancing aesthetics with performance, especially considering web font loading times
- Maintaining accessibility standards with the new font choice

By completing this task, we have taken a significant step towards modernizing the website's appearance and improving brand consistency. The next steps will focus on ensuring the font change is fully integrated and optimized across the entire web application.
