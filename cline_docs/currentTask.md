# Current Task

## Current Objective
Clean up and organize the repository

## Context
This task is part of the repository cleanup goal from projectRoadmap.md

## Completed Steps
1. Created essential documentation files:
   - projectRoadmap.md
   - currentTask.md (this file)
   - techStack.md
   - codebaseSummary.md
2. Created recommendation documents:
   - gitignore_recommendations.md
   - docker_recommendations.md
   - readme_recommendations.md
   - project_structure_recommendations.md
3. Implemented the recommendations:
   - Updated .gitignore file
   - Applied Docker configuration improvements (Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml)
   - Updated README.md
   - Reorganized the project structure
4. Created and updated unit tests (tests/test_calculator.py)
5. Implemented a health check endpoint (/health)
6. Updated cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md
7. Fixed import issues and made the application run correctly
8. Updated requirements.txt using uv pip freeze

## Next Steps
1. Perform a final review and validation
   - Ensure all changes are consistent
   - Verify that the application runs correctly in the Docker environment
2. Update documentation
   - Reflect any final changes in README.md and cline_docs files
3. Consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline (if applicable)

## Notes
- All unit tests are now passing
- The application can be run using `python -m src.app`
- Consider adding more comprehensive tests for other components (e.g., routes, validators)
- Explore options for improving code quality and maintainability (e.g., type hinting, docstrings)
