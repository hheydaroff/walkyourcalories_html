# Current Task

## Current Objective
Create a detailed timeline or sprint plan for the frontend implementation

## Context
This task is part of the new frontend implementation goal from projectRoadmap.md. We have completed the initial planning and documentation phase and are now moving into organizing the implementation process.

## Completed Steps
1. Updated projectRoadmap.md to include the new frontend implementation task
2. Created a detailed frontend implementation plan (frontend_implementation_guide.md)
3. Updated techStack.md to reflect new frontend technologies and frameworks
4. Created new Markdown files to document each page's structure and content:
   - homepage.md
   - how_it_works.md
   - benefits.md
   - faq.md
   - about_us.md
5. Updated codebaseSummary.md to include the new frontend structure
6. Reviewed all created and updated documents for consistency and completeness

## Next Steps
1. Break down the frontend implementation into smaller, manageable tasks
2. Estimate the time required for each task
3. Prioritize tasks based on their importance and dependencies
4. Allocate resources (if applicable) to each task
5. Set milestones and deadlines for key deliverables
6. Create a Gantt chart or similar visual representation of the timeline
7. Document the timeline or sprint plan in a new file: frontend_implementation_timeline.md
8. Update README.md to reflect the new frontend implementation timeline
9. Share the timeline with the development team for feedback and adjustments

## Additional Tasks (to be scheduled in the timeline)
1. Prepare additional resources or assets for the development team:
   - Design mockups or wireframes (if not already available)
   - Icon sets or other visual assets
   - Sample data for the calculator widget
2. Plan for testing and quality assurance of the new frontend:
   - Define acceptance criteria for each page and component
   - Outline a testing strategy (unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests)
   - Plan for cross-browser and responsive design testing
3. Create a style guide or component library for consistent design
4. Evaluate the need for updates to the backend API to support new frontend requirements
5. Plan for future internationalization and localization of the frontend

## Notes
- Ensure the timeline accounts for potential challenges and includes buffer time for unforeseen issues
- Consider breaking the implementation into sprints if using an Agile methodology
- Include time for code reviews, testing, and bug fixes in the timeline
- Allocate time for performance optimization and accessibility improvements
- Schedule regular check-ins or stand-ups to track progress and address any blockers
- Keep the timeline flexible to accommodate changes or new requirements that may arise during development

## Potential Challenges to Address in the Timeline
- Integrating the calculator widget seamlessly across different pages
- Maintaining performance with the addition of new frontend features
- Ensuring accessibility compliance throughout the new design
- Managing state across the application, especially for the calculator functionality
- Optimizing the site for various devices and screen sizes

By creating a detailed timeline or sprint plan, we will have a clear roadmap for the frontend implementation, helping us to manage the project more effectively and ensure timely delivery of the new features.
