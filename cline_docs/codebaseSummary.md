- Description: A web application that converts food calories to walking steps, helping users make informed health decisions.

## Key Components
1. Backend (Python/Flask)
   - src/app.py: Main application file
   - src/config.py: Configuration file
   - src/routes/main.py: Route handlers
   - src/services/calculator.py: Step calculation logic
   - src/utils/validators.py: Input validation functions

2. Frontend
   - templates/: HTML templates (Jinja2)
   - static/css/styles.css: Main stylesheet
   - static/js/main.js: Frontend interactivity

3. Testing
   - tests/test_calculator.py: Unit tests for calculator service

4. DevOps
   - Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml: Docker configuration
   - requirements.txt: Python dependencies

5. Documentation
   - cline_docs/: Project documentation files

## Project Structure
(Structure remains the same as in the original file)

## Tech Stack
1. Backend
   - Python
   - Flask web framework
   - Jinja2 templating engine

2. Frontend
   - HTML5 (semantic elements)
   - CSS3 (BEM methodology, Grid, Flexbox)
   - JavaScript (ES6+, Vanilla JS)

3. DevOps
   - Docker for containerization
   - Git for version control

4. Testing
   - pytest for backend testing
   - W3C Validators and Lighthouse for frontend testing

## Current Status
1. Backend functionality is implemented and working
2. Basic frontend structure is in place
3. Docker configuration is set up and functional
4. Unit tests for calculator service are implemented
5. Documentation has been updated and expanded

## Ongoing Tasks
1. Implementing new frontend design and structure (10-week plan)
2. Creating a comprehensive, multi-page user experience
3. Optimizing frontend performance and accessibility
4. Improving website content to enhance user engagement and clarity

## Upcoming Tasks
1. Review other pages of the website to ensure consistency with the new messaging on the benefits page
2. Update related documentation or content that references the benefits page
3. Consider updating other pages (e.g., homepage, how it works) to align with the new messaging
4. Review the entire website to ensure the new IBM Plex font is applied correctly and consistently
5. Test the website on different browsers and devices to verify font rendering and content display
6. Update any design documentation or style guides to reflect the new font choice and content changes
7. Consider performance implications of using web fonts and implement optimizations if necessary
8. Verify that all parts of the application are working correctly with the new calculator logic
9. Break down remaining frontend implementation tasks into smaller, manageable units
10. Enhance responsive design and improve accessibility
11. Conduct thorough testing and refinement of both design and content

## Potential Future Improvements
- Implement user authentication and profiles
- Add database integration for storing user data
- Implement more advanced step calculation algorithms
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline
- Implement analytics for user engagement tracking
- Explore progressive web app (PWA) capabilities
- Implement internationalization and localization

This summary reflects the current state of the Walk Your Calories project, incorporating recent changes and ongoing tasks. The focus is now on implementing the new frontend design and structure while maintaining and improving the existing backend functionality.
